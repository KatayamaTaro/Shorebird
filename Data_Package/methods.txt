Between 30 and 50 counts are conducted per year during daylight hours (1990-2022), where up to three staff or Volunteers-in-Parks (VIPs) walk a 60-minute unidirectional pass across the shoreline from the most- (Zone I) to least-visited (Zone III) intertidal area of the park, counting shorebirds and visitors. Survey dates occur between October and May when negative low tides between 10:00 AM and 4:00 PM reveal enough intertidal to traverse the 1.5 km extent in an hour period.Each survey begins 30 minutes prior to the predicted low tide time. Surveyors begin on the bluffs above Zone I, enter the tidepools at the single tidepool entrance in Zone I, and walk South in the intertidal zone, along the cliffs. As they traverse each zone for 15 minutes, they visually scan the intertidal zone using binoculars for shorebirds and visitors. To be included in counts, shorebirds must have their feet touching the substrate. Thus, birds floating in water or flying overhead are not counted. Surveyors record the number and species of their findings to the lowest taxonomic level possible.

To account for changes in the community due to weather conditions, environmental factors are measured immediately following each survey. A Kestrel hand-held weather gage is used to record air temperature, average wind speed, and maximum wind speed over a 60-second period. Wind direction is measured with a handheld compass during the same 60-second interval. Wave height (in feet) and cloud cover percentage are estimated by the surveyors. Note that survey efforts and methods vary over time. Prior to 2007, as many bird surveys as possible, given staffing levels, were conducted each year.
