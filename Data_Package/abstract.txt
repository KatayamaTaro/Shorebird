In an era of biodiversity loss, long-term datasets on bird abundance and biodiversity are critical indicators of ecosystem health. Here, we present observations and data exploration from over thirty years of shorebird monitoring at Cabrillo National Monument (CABR). Park staff and volunteers have been collecting shorebird and shoreline visitor information data since 1990 over roughly 15-50 one-hour visual counts per year (1990-2022). During each count, up to three volunteers walk 60-minutes one-way  along 1.5 km of shoreline from the most visited to the least visited intertidal area of the park, counting shorebirds and visitors. Exploratory data visualization indicates that observed changes in shorebird abundance are largely driven by gulls, and that shorebird abundance is negatively correlated with the number of visitors to the area. This program provides valuable information for resource managers regarding the effects of climate change, status of restoration efforts, and the effects of visitation on shorebirds at a high-visitation urban park.
